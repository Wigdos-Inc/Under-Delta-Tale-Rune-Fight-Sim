Battles and Enemies in Undertale and Deltarune
Undertale
Aaron (Waterfall) – Attacks with flexing muscular arms that move upward from the right and left sides of the bullet board, speeding up as time goes by. Then drops sweat droplets straight down and diagonally from the top of the box. These sweats are WHITE projectiles (not blue). Survive by weaving between the sweat drops. Spare by using the "Flex" ACT three times - the first time he takes it as a challenge, the second time he flexes harder, and the third time he flexes so hard that he leaves. If Aaron appears due to flexing at a Temmie, he only requires one flex to leave. No route-based variation (in all routes Aaron behaves similarly).
Asgore Dreemurr (New Home final boss) – Uses fire and trident attacks
. Patterns include double-helix spirals of red fireballs (8 damage, weave between helix gaps)
; cross fire walls: streams of fireballs from sides leaving cover except center (6‑8 dmg)
; spiraling partial rings of fire encasing the board (gets faster with time)
; tracking fireballs: Asgore’s paws leave fireballs that home in on the soul’s last position (6 dmg)
; ripple rings: large rings of fireballs sweeping corners (6 dmg)
; and a trident sweep: eyes flash blue/orange then his trident sweeps across entire board, requiring alternating stand-still (for blue) and movement (for orange)
. On Pacifist, Asgore can’t be spared until killed or lowered HP to dialogue; on Genocide he taunts and attacks similarly. Player must dodge fast by reading patterns (e.g. staying in gap of spirals, moving with tracked fire) and can use Toriel’s pie or talk lowers his AT/DF.
Photoshop Flowey / Omega Flowey (Neutral Route boss) – This is FLOWEY's boss form, not Asriel. Omega Flowey unleashes bullet-hell with mixed patterns. Attacks include star-shaped projectiles, flamethrowers, vine attacks, bombs, and laser sweeps from different "face" attacks. During the fight, the six human SOULs help you - each SOUL phase has themed attacks (knife, glove, notebook, etc.). Using ACT commands related to each soul turns hostile bullets into healing green bullets. The fight is scripted so you cannot die permanently - if you die, a SOUL revives you. Player HP is set to 50. This fight only appears on Neutral route after defeating Asgore. Note: ASRIEL DREEMURR is a separate boss fight that only appears in True Pacifist route and cannot be lost.
Astigmatism (CORE Hard Mode enemy) – Fires bouncing orbs and spinning orb patterns
. First, it fires single large bullets that bounce off walls then shoot straight (accelerating after bounce)
. Second, it launches horizontal rows of three spinning orbs across the screen. The orbs often spiral or bounce unpredictably. Dodging: predict bounce points (they move faster later) and weave through the multi-orb groups. No route differences (Hard Mode only after meeting boss conditions).
Dogamy & Dogaressa (Snowdin miniboss) – A duo that uses axe and heart attacks
. Dogamy throws two big axes from above that fall in sync to form a heart shape at the bottom (5 dmg each)
, and bark-shoots rings of eight heart bullets towards Dogaressa: half of the hearts are blue (allow passing in blue mode)
. If one partner dies:
Killing Dogaressa leaves Dogamy single-bark: he launches a small downward bark-heart (weaker).
Killing Dogamy causes Dogaressa to throw axes rapidly from above (faster heart-breaking axes).
How to dodge: stay under the falling axes or near edges, and weave through the heart rings (blue hearts allow stand-still, orange hearts require moving). Spare: “Roll Around” to amuse them, then “Pet” each. Alternatively, giving the Stick spares instantly. No special route changes except dialogue in Genocide.
Doggo (Snowdin) – Blue sword sweep attack. A sweeping blue beam that appears as a short sword scans across the board horizontally. It is a blue attack (must stand still to avoid damage). The trick: Doggo only sees you if you move. Therefore stand still to let the blue sweep pass over without damage. Spare: after enduring one sweep (no movement), use "Pet". You can also spare by throwing the Stick. Very rare chance (0.5%) he may do a different attack. Genocide: can be killed, but not required – killing Doggo still continues route.
Dummy (Ruins) – No attacks; the Dummy does not shoot bullets at all. It only taunts with “EN GARDE”. You can spare immediately. (If attacked, it cries and runs away harmlessly.)
Final Froggit (CORE) – Uses Froggit-style bullet swarms
. It spawns rapid small flying bullets (six flies then parabola arcs) much faster than Froggit. Also may jump around (like Froggit). Essentially an intensified Froggit. Survive by moving lightly – Blue/Orange meaning apply normally (bullets move straight down). No special gimmicks beyond higher speed.
Flowey – Not a traditional bullet boss, but Flowey (Asriel) final form on Neutral acts like Omega Flowey (covered above). In Genocide, Flowey is bypassed (you defeat boss family or kill them).
Froggit (Ruins) – Two main attacks: it shoots small flies that spawn from the top and move in arcs or waves (around 5 flies that move downward in patterns), and occasionally does a jumping frog pattern. The fly waves can be dodged by moving; frog jumps are avoided by moving horizontally. Froggit is one of the first enemies you encounter and is relatively easy. Can be spared immediately by using "Compliment" after one turn, or by sparing multiple times. In Genocide route, Froggit may run away when its HP is low.
Greater Dog (Snowdin) – Uses dog-themed attacks. Primary attack: a small white dog ("Annoying Dog") appears if you move, then barks and sends a projectile upward. To avoid this, stay still when the dog appears. Other attacks include: a large dog head/spear that may have blue/white sections (stand still for blue parts, dodge white parts). The dog gets excited easily. Spare by using "Pet" multiple times (usually 3-4 times) until Greater Dog gets too excited and becomes spareable. Petting also lowers his attack power. No special route changes.
Ice Cap (Snowdin) – Two modes. First, in Snowdin: fire hat pattern: magician’s top hats at bottom shoot falling ice blobs that ascend then drop (like pillars). Second, ice wave: two big zig-zag columns from top move inward (safe gaps between them)
. In Castle Town (post-pacifist), it uses glow after you “compliment”, then you can spare by “Compliment” again. Dodging: weave through the wave gaps, and stay out from under falling hats. (In Castle Town after compliment, it leaves and then can be spared.) No additional route differences.
Jerry (Snowdin) – No direct bullet attacks. Instead, Jerry is an annoyance enemy that appears with other monsters and makes battles take longer by ditching turns and making other enemies wait. He doesn't attack but wastes time. He has very high defense and check text shows "???". To spare: you can "Ditch" Jerry to remove him from battle without consequences to Pacifist route. If you kill Jerry, you only get 1 EXP and it does NOT abort Genocide route (he's optional). Jerry is notable for being universally disliked by all monsters and players due to his time-wasting mechanics.
Knight Knight (CORE) – A giant meteor-spell boss
. Attacks include: meteor showers from upper-left; spiral sunburst (orange bullets spiraling outward from sun symbol); and Morningstar smash: a star/club appears and slams down (covering a wide area). The rotating Morningstar moves off-screen then reappears to slam down in columns. Player survival requires moving through safe spaces between meteors and getting under the spiral. (As a Hard Mode enemy, he has no special route differences.)
Loox (Ruins) – Bulb-like enemy that throws bouncing orbs
. It first spawns five bouncing spheres from the sides that ricochet around (growing faster each bounce). Second, it spawns several worm-shaped orb trails from sides that wiggle forward (similar to worms in puzzles)
. The orbs/worms do non-homing movement: stay mostly still and dodge as they pass. Gimmick: Choosing “Picking On” (killing it) boosts your exp by 1 and speeds up Loox’s attacks; “Don’t Pick On” lets you spare easily (moldspeed normal). No route-based change beyond that.
Lesser Dog (Snowdin) – Eyes follow you, so any movement will make it bark (and shoot a bullet); if you stand still, it sits quietly. Its only bullet is a fast upward bark if it barks
. To avoid, remain still so it doesn’t attack at all. Spare by “Pet” after a turn of stillness. No route differences (counts as undead in genocide).
Mad Dummy (Waterfall miniboss) – Mix of dummy robots and sprite attacks
. Patterns: it summons small Mad Dummy clones. Some clones flash red and slide horizontally across the board (they form rows with gaps)
, and others shoot fuzzy white scribble beams straight down (5 dmg if hit). Then Homering rockets: small rocket clones chase the soul’s position briefly then rocket straight down (7 dmg if hit)
. Finally, Mad Dummy throws a large knife at you (7 dmg). After these main attacks, Napstablook’s ghost tears may fall (1 dmg each, avoidable). Strategy: stay between axes of clones, avoid rockets by horizontal movement, and dodge the knife by standing still at the moment of throw. Spare by repeatedly acting “Cheer” three times; then love the top hat trick. No extra route changes (though Napstablook cameo appears).
Madjick (CORE Hard Mode) – A mage that casts orbs
. Primary attack “Chaser Orb”: a single glowing orb launches from bottom and slowly chases the soul, leaving cross-shaped traps behind. The orb speeds up after corners. Secondary “Corner Orb”: an orb appears in a side corner (warning arrow shows location), then fires a volley of cross-shaped bullets and teleports to another corner (changes color each teleport). If stared at (X action) triggers “Three’s a Crowd”: spawns three chasers instead of one
. Dodging: move continuously to avoid chasers, and after each corner burst dodge the cross patterns. Unique: it toggles between one chaser and triples if you LOOK (eye). No route difference beyond that.
Moldsmal (Ruins) – Shoots falling pellets
. It first drops zigzagging pellets from top (small shots in a zig pattern)
. Second, it drops pellets that explode mid-air into a ring of smaller pellets (like a bomb). The patterns are vertical and predictable. Dodging: avoid the initial swarms by staying away, and avoid the circular bombs by seeing them form and moving out. You can immediately spare with “Melt” (punch). Bonus: giving it Dinner (butterscotch) makes the pellets green and heal you instead of hurt
. No route difference.
Moldbygg (Waterfall) – A giant upside-down Moldsmal
. It has two attacks: from bottom spawns small Moldevuilds that shoot upward (like mirror of Moldsmal); and from sides it shoots 8-bullet volleys that converge toward center then shoot upward
. Bullets bounce at floor then rise. Survive by horizontal moves. After a short intro dialogue, it may lower AT by Toriel Pie etc. No special route differences.
Muffet (Hotland miniboss) – Spider-queen with patterned webs
. Attacks cycle among: waves of blue strings of spiders dropping (6 dmg), thrown croissants that boomerang (6 dmg)
, bouncing donuts dropping (6 dmg)
, and after phase 2 (purple) spider-call: she summons webs that trap you (spider strings) and slower single spiders fall
. The three web spikes block certain columns; in purple form, a pet spider (pet) appears too. Dodge: weave through webs by moving to safe columns. Unique: purple bar gradually appears after two volleys; biting it ends the fight. On Pacifist/Neutral you must beat her (buy Spider Donut or Ally for advantage). On Genocide, killing her yields spiders as usual. No alternate route patterns.
Napstablook (Waterfall) – A ghost that cries tears as bullets. Attacks: drops tears in arcs from above (about 3 tears in downward arcs), and tears that fall and bounce off the floor. Tears move slowly and are easy to dodge. Unique mechanic: Napstablook is INVINCIBLE - you cannot kill them because they're a ghost. On turn 2, they say "really not feeling up to it right now..." and may lie down, making the battle easier. You can "Cheer" them up multiple times to eventually end the battle peacefully, or wait and they'll leave on their own. In Genocide route, attacking Napstablook gives you 0 EXP because ghosts can't be killed, but Genocide route continues normally. They appear in Waterfall, not Ruins.
Papyrus (Snowdin boss) – Bone patterns with occasional blue soul mode. His attacks include: regular white bones from top/bottom with safe gaps that you dodge normally; blue bones that you must stand completely still to avoid; and combination attacks with platforms. His "Cool Dude" special attack has many fast blue bones with moving platforms. To survive: move through white bone gaps, stand still for blue bones, and jump when necessary. Pacifist: you can spare Papyrus after surviving enough turns or by lowering his HP - he will eventually spare you himself. Genocide: Papyrus offers to spare you but can be killed; his attacks remain identical. After the battle, you can date/hang out with Papyrus.
Pyrope (Hotland) – Fireball and chain attacks
. Bomb Wave: throws multiple bombs from edges; they bounce off floor and explode, often in chains
. Burning Rope: a horizontal rotating saw of flame moves across the board (orange, so stand still to avoid, as it inflicts burns). The rope covers a horizontal line. Dodge by moving vertically to avoid the flame line. No special route differences (just Hard Mode location).
Royal Guards (Hotland) – Two armored guards combine attacks
. They alternate team attacks: from top drop vegetables like Vegetoid (heal if collected in Dinner)
, and shoot vertical star bullets down (safe gaps in center)
. If one guard is killed, the other goes berserk: attack rate doubles. If you disarm RG02 via an item (Turning Red shield), it malfunctions: its shots scatter randomly off-screen
. Tactics: shoot away RG02’s shield early to ease battle (its bullets become erratic); dodge the falling spikes by hugging sides. In Pacifist/Neutral you can spare both. In Genocide you kill one then the other; if all Hotland kills done, Mettaton NEO may appear.
Sans (Genocide route boss) – Appears ONLY in Genocide route. Uses bone attacks and "Gaster Blasters" (skull-shaped laser beams). His attacks are extremely fast and difficult: he fires patterns of bones from multiple directions, uses gravity manipulation to slam your soul around the battle box, and combines these with timed laser blasts. The blue soul gravity effect pulls you downward, requiring constant jumping. Attacks include: horizontal bones at varying heights, vertical bone walls, and synchronized blaster beams. Sans has only 1 HP but dodges every attack automatically - you must wait until he's tired (after many turns) to land a hit. He also breaks game rules by attacking during your turn and in menus. This is considered the hardest boss fight in Undertale. Only appears in Genocide; Pacifist/Neutral routes you never fight him.
Shyren (Waterfall) – Whistle-singer fish that converts to sprite. Initially unattainable, but after certain acts (cheer) becomes friendly and joins you. As an enemy (first encounter), it has a single magic bullet volley: it repeatedly swipes and fires orange sharps from its horn in an oscillating pattern (speeding up) until cheered. Dodge by bobbing under or above the wave. (In battles, it can be pacified by befriending or ending up on True Pacifist). No major combat beyond initial encounter.
So Sorry (Hotland mini-boss) – Optional boss that appears in Art Club room on specific dates. Uses drawing/animation themed attacks: tail swipes that create blue and orange slashes (dodge blue by standing still, dodge orange by moving), drawings that come to life as projectiles, and "Doodle Bogs" (small creatures that create bullet patterns). The attacks can fill much of the battle box. Strategy: dodge carefully through small gaps, and use ACT commands to reduce his aggression. So Sorry is very apologetic and can be spared through repeated ACT commands. Unique note: This boss does NOT involve Susie or give a key to Mettaton (those are from Deltarune/different contexts). Appears only in specific room under specific conditions.
Toriel (Ruins boss) – Uses fire magic attacks. She fires waves of fireballs in various patterns: hand-sweep attacks where fireballs come from her hands on the sides, requiring you to move up and down to dodge; and wave patterns of multiple fireballs. As the fight progresses, her attacks intentionally avoid hitting you at low HP (she doesn't want to hurt you). Her dialogue changes but attack patterns remain similar across Genocide/Pacifist. You can spare her by attempting to Spare repeatedly (around 24 times) until she stops attacking and lets you go. Players can also weaken her by eating Butterscotch Pie.
Tsunderplane (Hotland) – Flying plane with staggered attacks
. It flies in from sides, dropping bombs which leave vertical smoke trails (hazards on columns)
. It also dives from top, leaving a horizontal smoke line (covering a row). After its opening dialogue (“approach”), all plane trails become green (invalid/damaging) zones – touching them ends fight. You must shoot out the “NO ENTRY” sign to clear the green zones. Dodge by moving through gaps in smoke lines, and shoot the yellow sign when available. No route-specific change.
Undyne (Waterfall boss) – Spear attacks with soul color changes. Initially starts with GREEN soul mode where you can't move freely but can block spears. Spears come from all directions (yellow arrows indicate direction). After the first phase, soul changes to RED allowing free movement. Second phase uses spear patterns: vertical spears falling, horizontal waves, and X-formations of converging spears. Spears can be white (normal), blue (stand still), or yellow/turning red (warning then attack). Genocide route has "Undyne the Undying" form with much higher stats and more intense spear patterns including rotating spear rings. In Neutral/Pacifist, you can spare Undyne by surviving long enough and fleeing, or the battle ends through story progression.
Undyne the Undying (Genocide) – Enhanced version with same core mechanics as regular Undyne but significantly harder. Always uses RED soul mode (free movement). She has extremely high HP (23000) and her spear attacks are much faster and more numerous. Repeatedly spawns large groups of spears in various patterns: spinning rings of spears, dense walls of spears from multiple directions, and rapid arrow-spear formations. The attacks are very dense and fast, requiring constant movement. This is one of the hardest mandatory fights in Genocide route. She can only be defeated through persistence and cannot be spared.
Vegetoid (Ruins) – Throws falling vegetables from the top of the battle box. Vegetables (carrots, celery, etc.) fall in various patterns. The key mechanic: if you use ACT "Eat" on Vegetoid's vegetables during the attack, they become GREEN healing bullets that restore HP instead of damaging you. Otherwise vegetables are normal white/orange projectiles that damage on contact. This makes Vegetoid useful for healing. Can be spared immediately by using "Dinner" ACT. The pattern itself consists of simple vertical drops. No special route changes.
Vulkin (Hotland) – Volcano enemy that uses fire and lightning attacks. Lightning attack: gray clouds appear and shoot zig-zag lightning bolts downward (these are WHITE attacks, not blue - dodge by moving). Volcano attack: fireballs shoot upward from bottom then arc down. The attacks alternate and get slightly faster over time. Vulkin is known for being "kind" - it tries to "help" but ends up hurting you with its "healing" attacks. Can be spared by using "Encourage" ACT or by sparing when merciful. No special route differences.
Whimsun (Ruins) – Shoots moth swarms
. First a ring of six moths spins around the heart (shrinking/expanding). Then two vertical lines of moths slide upward from bottom. None actually track the soul; they just form patterns (and loops). They deal 3-4 dmg each. Dodging: stay off the center paths and leave gaps for waves to pass. Unique: Whimsun always dies in one hit, so you can always immediately spare at start. No route differences.
Whimsalot (CORE) – Faster, multi-hit version of Whimsun
. It spawns butterflies in circular waves and columns. Pattern: a 3-butterfly circle around soul (two blue, one green if you have “Shining Tail”, green gives 4 hp) and three-blue butterflies rising from bottom. The speed is high. If you have the “Shining Tail” accessory, one bullet in the ring is green (heal bullet)
. Dodge by weaving circles and moving under descending trio. Only appears in CORE Hard Mode, no route change.
Woshua (Waterfall) – Spirals water bullets
. It launches a spiral of blue water drops from center (growing circular pattern) and a large floating soap bar that travels sideways, dropping tiny healing stars
. The water spirals require circling the safe spot; the soap car’s stars move like slow bullets (white squares that fall). The soap moves unpredictably along the board edges. If made tired/defeated, it yields Core Grill. No route variation.
Yarn and Glitch enemies (True Lab) – In True Lab there are “garbage” monsters (e.g. Space Core Challenge). For example, “SENTRY” and “HOTLAND LAZY” bosses fire alternating blaster and morphing shapes. Their patterns are outside the scope here. [We did not find details in sources].
Deltarune
(Enemies are listed by game chapter; all battles are essentially Neutral since Deltarune has no classic pacifist/genocide modes. Some have alternate outcomes in the “Snowgrave” or “date” routes.)
Rudinn (Field, Card Castle) – Fires diamond shards
. Its attack “Diamond Cutter” spawns several diamond shots from above that home in once. “Diamond Release” spawns diamonds from below that rise up. The patterns are straight shots (tracking). Dodge by moving out of the diamond’s path. Strategy: Rudinn can be Pacified by Ralsei’s lecture when Tired, or convinced after warning 10 times
. Unique: being a heart suit, when Tired it can be spared, unlike many enemies. No Snowgrave changes.
Hathy (Field, Card Castle) – Throws heart bullets
. If multiple enemies present, it creates a rotating ring of hearts (blue bullets) that shrink the play area
. If alone, it releases a single heart that spins then flies straight. Dodge by staying outside the ring or dodging the single. Spare: Ralsei’s Lecturing or Susie’s Flatter quickly pacifies it, or 10 spares makes it Tired
. Known for its role (Ralsei is based on heart). No additional route.
Clover (Forest) – Triplet club-wielders with spread attacks
. Attack patterns include: clubs from board edges firing three 3-way spreads at the soul, and clubs flying in and exploding into three slow pellets. Dodging: weave between the spread shots and under flying clubs. In Rematch (Cyber World), they also fire club bullets downward from tail. Unique: you can fill her Mercy by topic-based ACTs (“Talk” on birthdays etc). No Snowgrave route difference.
Ponman (Card Castle) – Pawn-like armor that teles shots
. It shoots 1–3 tracking diamond bullets from its helmet. They home moderately. Dodge by unpredictably moving. Gimmick: Kris can use “Goodnight” to instantly put Ponmen to sleep (makes spare trivial). Also Ralsei’s Lullaby sleeps all and tires remaining
. Without acts, reduce HP to one-third to tire. No Pacifist/Genocide analog in Deltarune.
Jigsawry (Field) – Fires jigsaw pieces
. It summons two puzzle-piece halves on sides; after a moment they dash together across the board (tracking the soul’s horizontal position) like a closing door. Essentially one horizontally converging shot. Dodge by moving vertically as they connect. Befriend ACT instantly spares it (makes all Jigsawrys friendly)
. Susie’s Warning must be used before friendly (if present). Snowgrave has no effect on them.
Round (Card Castle) – Coin knights (Clock/King of Swords). They use flipping attacks (throw coins or flip, not detailed here). (The wiki likely has similar bullet patterns, but omitted for brevity).
Lancer (Castle Town, Card Castle) – A boss character but his "attacks" are mostly harmless or comedic. His attacks include: throwing bikes/motorcycles across the screen (can be dodged easily), and various silly patterns. Lancer is more of a story character than a real threat. Can be defeated or spared through various ACT options depending on the situation. In some encounters, he's automatically spared through dialogue.
Jevil (Chapter 1 Secret Boss) – Extremely difficult optional boss. Uses chaos-themed attacks: rapid spade/club/diamond/heart projectiles, spinning scythe attacks ("Devilsknife"), carousel patterns where he rides a carousel while shooting, and "Final Chaos" with screen-filling projectiles. His attacks are very fast and cover large areas. Can be defeated by reducing HP to 0 (FIGHT) or pacified by using Pirouette/Hypnosis ACTs until his TIRED meter fills (SPARE). Beating him gives the Devilsknife weapon or Jevilstail armor depending on method. One of the hardest fights in Deltarune.
Spamton NEO (Chapter 2 Secret Boss) – Found in optional route. Spamton NEO is a giant robot form that uses phone/advertisement themed attacks: pipis (blue egg-like projectiles that explode), phone attacks, heart-shaped projectile rings, and nose attacks. Also uses large hands that grab/attack. The fight has multiple phases and is extremely difficult. Can be defeated through fighting or by cutting wires during ACT commands. Regular Spamton (non-NEO) is fought earlier and is much easier. Spamton NEO gives the Dealmaker armor or Puppet Scarf depending on completion method.
Queen (Chapter 2 Boss) – Uses various mech-based attacks and mini-games. The fight involves multiple phases with different mechanics: arcade-style segments, bullet patterns with her floating head, and attacks from her Giga Queen mech. Bullet patterns include: energy balls, lasers, and various projectile formations. The fight is more story-driven and has multiple ACT options. Can be defeated through combat or through story progression with the right ACT choices. Note: Deltarune has no "genocide" route - all routes focus on pacifist or alternate story paths like Snowgrave.
Maus, Swatchling, Werewire, Tasque, Virovirokun, Ambyu-Lance, Poppup, Sweet Cap'n Cakes, K.K., Berdly, Rouxls Kaard, etc. – Various Darkners encountered in Chapters 1 and 2. Each has unique attack patterns: Tasque shoots cat-themed projectiles; Werewire uses electricity/wire attacks; Virovirokun spawns virus enemies; Ambyu-Lance drives across the screen; Maus creates mouse-hole patterns; Swatchling uses color-coded attacks; Berdly uses tornado/wind attacks. Generally these enemies can be pacified through specific ACT commands unique to each enemy. Note: Snowgrave is an alternate route (not genocide) that changes some encounters, particularly involving Noelle using ice magic.
Noelle (not a real boss fight) – Noelle is a party member in Deltarune, not an enemy. She doesn't have a traditional boss fight. In normal gameplay she assists the party with ice magic. In the Snowgrave alternate route, she becomes a powerful ally who uses IceShock to freeze enemies. There is no scenario where you fight Noelle as an enemy.
Flowey (brief appearance) – In Deltarune, Flowey makes a very brief cameo appearance but is not fought. He appears at the very end of Chapter 1 in a flower pot. This is just a story reference/easter egg and not a boss fight.
Survival and Responses: In Undertale, the Blue/Orange soul mechanic dictates standing still vs moving to avoid bullets (e.g. stand still for blue spears, move for orange). Many enemy bullets are heart-shaped or elemental-themed. Players must recognize patterns (falling carrots, swirling rings, etc.) and respond by moving/or not moving. Spares often come from dialogues, flattery, or special items, varying by route. In Deltarune, there is no hurting/killing requirement; many enemies can be spared by correct ACTs (Flatter, Lecture, Talk). Their bullet attacks are generally simpler (non-lethal patterns) but still require dodging (e.g. bullet spreads, or single tracking shots). Common strategy: use ACTs to end battles safely or reduce enemy hp to trigger tired status.
Sources: Patterns and mechanics are documented on game wikis
. These cover attacks, bullet types (e.g. heart, star, arrow projectiles), and special fight conditions for each enemy.
ADDITIONAL UNDERTALE ENEMIES:

Chilldrake (Snowdin) – Ice drake enemy that uses cold-themed attacks. Shoots ice crystals and frozen projectiles from various angles. Often appears with Snowdrake. Can be spared by telling jokes or ignoring its attempts to be cool. Attacks include falling ice shards and horizontal ice beams. Dodge by weaving between projectiles.

Doggo (Snowdin) – Guard dog that only sees moving objects. Uses a single blue sword sweep attack that appears as a short sword scanning horizontally across the battle box. The key mechanic: stand completely still to avoid damage, as Doggo cannot see stationary objects. Can be spared by petting after surviving one attack without moving. Part of the Canine Unit.

Dogamy & Dogaressa (Snowdin miniboss) – Married dog couple that fights as a team. Dogamy throws two large axes that fall to form a heart shape at the bottom. They also shoot rings of heart-shaped bullets (mix of blue and white). If one is killed, the other's attack pattern changes and becomes more aggressive. Spare by using "Roll Around" then "Pet" both of them. Alternatively, giving them the Stick instantly spares them. Their synchronization is their strength.

Lesser Dog (Snowdin) – Small dog with a battle axe. Similar to Doggo - barks and attacks if it detects movement. Will shoot a fast upward bark bullet if the player moves during its turn. Stand completely still to avoid attacks. Can be spared by petting repeatedly. With each pet, its neck extends longer (comedic element). Very excitable and desperate for affection.

Greater Dog (Snowdin) – Large armored dog. Uses two main attacks: a floating dog head that alternates between blue (stand still) and white (dodge normally), and the "annoying dog" which appears if you move and sends upward projectiles. Best strategy is to remain still to prevent the annoying dog from appearing. Requires multiple pets (3-4 times) to spare, as it becomes increasingly excited with each pet. Part of the Royal Guard's Canine Unit.

Temmie (Waterfall) – The iconic vibrating creature. Has extremely unusual stats: 20 ATK but -20 DEF, making it very fragile. Attacks with Temmie Flakes and random vibrating projectiles. Can be spared by talking or paying for Temmie College. Notable: if you flex at Temmie, Aaron will appear. Temmie is considered one of the silliest enemies in the game. Attacks are relatively simple pattern-based projectiles.

Mad Dummy (Waterfall miniboss) – Possessed training dummy that cannot be damaged by normal attacks (must reflect its own attacks back). Summons smaller dummy clones that slide horizontally across the screen in rows. Also launches homing rockets that briefly track the player before shooting straight down. Finally throws a large knife attack. After several waves, Napstablook's tears may fall. Spare by using "Cheer" three times. Unique fight mechanic: you cannot attack directly - must avoid attacks until story progression ends the fight.

Royal Guards (RG 01 & RG 02) (Hotland) – Two elite guard brothers working together. They drop vegetables from above (can heal if eaten) and shoot star-shaped bullets downward with safe gaps. If one dies, the other goes berserk with doubled attack rate. Special mechanic: if you "Clean Armor" on RG 02 or use specific items, his attacks become erratic and scattered. Can be spared by showing teamwork between them. Both must be alive and content to spare them together.

So Sorry (Hotland secret boss) – Optional boss that appears in the Art Club room on October 10th at 8 PM (system time). Uses drawing-themed attacks: tail slashes with blue/orange patterns, paper ball barrages, and summons "Doodle Bogs" that shoot bullet patterns. Attacks can fill much of the battle box. Very apologetic character. Can be spared through compliments and art-related ACTs. Notable for being a Kickstarter backer's character design. Does NOT involve Susie or Mettaton keys (those don't exist in Undertale).

HARD MODE ONLY ENEMIES:

Parsnik (Ruins - Hard Mode) – Rebellious root vegetable, similar to Vegetoid but more aggressive. Uses enhanced vegetable-based attacks. Can only be encountered in Hard Mode (accessible by naming the fallen human "Frisk"). Attacks include faster falling vegetables and more complex patterns.

Moldessa (Ruins - Hard Mode) – Glamorous version of Moldbygg. Uses slime-based attacks with more style. Poses provocatively and shoots enhanced moldform projectiles. Hard Mode exclusive enemy with slightly higher stats than regular mold enemies.

Migospel (Ruins - Hard Mode) – Missionary insect monster, enhanced version of Migosp. Preaches while attacking. Uses bug swarm patterns and gospel-themed bullet formations. Hard Mode exclusive. Can be spared by praying or listening to its sermons.

Glyde (Snowdin - Optional/Hard Mode) – Wealthy art dealer monster. Large flying creature that appears in a specific room in Snowdin Forest (requires specific conditions). Uses projectile attacks from multiple angles. Considered semi-optional as it requires backtracking and specific actions to encounter. Attacks are more complex than regular Snowdin enemies. Can be spared through monetary offerings or appreciating its art.
